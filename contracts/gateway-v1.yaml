      summary: Discover patient's accounts
      description: >
        Request for patient care context discover, made by CM for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts
          1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**
          2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**
          3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**
          4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**
          5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**
          6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**
          7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**
          8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transcationId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**
