    Gateway is the hub that routes/orchestrates the interaction between consent managers and API bridges. There are 5 categories of APIs; discovery, link, consent flow, data flow and  monitoring. To reflect the consumers of APIs, the above apis are also categorized under cm facing, hiu facing and hip facing
